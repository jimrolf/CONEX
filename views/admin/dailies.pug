            p Each day when a student logs into Canvas, a flag on the home page will link to that day's assignment, if there is one. To create a daily assignment, simply follow these steps:
            ol
                li
                    p Create the assignment in Canvas like any other assignment, and take note of the assignment ID, which can be found in the URL when editing it.
                li
                    p For each daily task in your course, enter the assignment ID on this page. Note that the system will not recognize Quiz IDs (usually five digits). If your assignment is classified as a quiz by Canvas, click the "Assignments" tab to see its assignment ID (generally six digits).
                li
                    p Every weekday at midnight your course's homepage will update with that day's Daily Task. If there are no daily tasks left in the system, or if a student logs in on a Saturday or Sunday, a Missing Assignment resource page will be linked on the homepage.
