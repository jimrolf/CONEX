    <div class="coach_bio">I am Darnisha Augustin, a rising third-year student at the University of Virginia from West Palm Beach, Florida. I was born and raised in South Florida and decided to make the move to Virginia to attend UVa in person. I am majoring in Biology and Sociology on the pre-PA track. After my time at the University of Virginia, I will apply to the Masterâ€™s in Public Health program at the University of Virginia Medical School and thereafter, attend an accredited Physician Associate program and live out a career as a Physician Associate. 
A fun fact about me is that I have danced at the halftime shows for both the Miami Dolphins and Miami Heat twice with my competitive cheerleading team. The experience was extremely rewarding and thrilling. It was great to meet some of the players and the cheerleaders as well.
Additionally, I like to do various activities in my free time such as jump roping and working out. At the moment I enjoy learning choreography as well as choreographing some dances for my afro-beats dance team at UVa. I find dancing to be an enjoyable outlet besides my schoolwork. It also comes with its health benefits which is a plus. Besides that, I also enjoy listening to music and reading. Those activities help calm me when life gets too hectic. </div>
